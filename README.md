Cooline for WoW Classic

CoolLine is a spell/item cooldown mod that displays icons on a single bar/line to give you an idea of when it will be ready. There is no bar timer and no text timer.

CoolLine is inspired by Forte_Cooldown (a module in the ForteXorcist package). CoolLine is basically a stripped down and standalone version written from scratch. The name comes from putting "cooldown" and "timeline" together (yes, lame).

How to Use:

Change settings - "/coolline" or check Interface Options -> AddOns  
Change position and size - unlock to make it draggable and resizable  
Filter/unfilter a spell or item cooldown - "/coolline Spell Item Name Link"  
Add more fonts/texture - CoolLine uses LibSharedMedia
